            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Ritika and I'm currently a junior at Tulane University studying Math, Computer Science, and Econ. I have always been interested in artificial intellegence, and I love to create and build. I am currently on my learning journey so I've created this page to document my A.I. learning journey, as well as other stuff related to coding. This is mainly a portfolio website to showcase my projects that I will add soon, but I also made this site to help others learn AI. This was also written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML if anyone was wondering lol</p>
