        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi my name is Ritika, I am a junior studying math, computer science, and economics. I am very interested in pursuing a career in AI and just learning anything I can. I made this page so I can document my projects but I also wanted to add my notes and things I've learned and found useful for other people also interested in similar topics.</p>
