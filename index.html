    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hi my name is Ritika, I am a computer science, math, and economics major. I am really interested in learning AI, and I love creating things and solving problems. I created this website to document my journey learning AI and showcase different projects that I complete. I also created this website to upload any notes, books, lecutres, and other course work that I found useful for learning AI. </p>
