            <h2>About</h2>
            <p> Hi,my name is Ritika and I am currently a junior at Tulane University studying Mathematics, Computer Science, and Economics. This is mainly a portfolio website to showcase my projects, but I also made this site to help others learn AI and keep a refrence for myself. I will also add other stuff that is in the realm of coding, such as my notes on how to learn Swift, which is not A.I. but app developement. I hope you enjoy! Also if you were wondering I used HTML, CSS, and JS to code this website.   </p>
